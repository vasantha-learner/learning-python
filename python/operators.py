# Identity operator:These checks whether two varibles pointing to the same value.
# is,is not

# a=[1,2,3]
# b=a
# c=[1,2,3]
# print(b is a)
# print(a is b)

# Membership operators:
# in,not in

# Bit-Wise opertors:These opertaor works similar to logicak operators but operates bit by bit.
# bit-it is the smallest value in a computer memory
# &,|,~,^,<<,>>
# print(~8)
